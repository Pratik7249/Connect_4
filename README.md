 ## Game Rules ‚Äì 4 in a Row

The game is played on a **7√ó6 grid**. Players take turns dropping discs into one of the columns. The disc falls to the lowest available space in that column.

## Requirements

### 1. üßç Player Matchmaking

- Players enter a username and wait for an opponent.
- If no second player joins within **10 seconds**, a **competitive bot** should start the game with the waiting user.

### 2. üß† Competitive Bot

- The bot must:
    - Play with valid game logic
    - Make **strategic decisions** to:
        - Block the opponent from winning
        - Try to win when it has an opportunity
    - Respond quickly to player moves
    
    ‚ùó The bot should **not** play random moves. It should analyse the board and prioritise:
    
    - Blocking player‚Äôs immediate win
    - Creating its own winning path###
    
### 3. üåê Real-Time Gameplay

- Use **WebSockets** to support real-time turn-based play.
- Both players should see updates immediately after each move.
- **If a player disconnects**, they should be able to **rejoin the same game within 30 seconds** using their username or game ID.
- If they don‚Äôt reconnect within 30 seconds:
    - The game is forfeited.
    - The opponent (or bot) is declared the winner.

### 4. üßæ Game State Handling

- Maintain in-memory state for active games.
- Store completed games persistently (e.g. Postgres).

### 5. üèÖ Leaderboard

- Track **number of games won per player**.
- show leaderboard on the frontend.

### Winning Conditions:

- The first player to connect **4 discs** vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
- If the board fills up with no winner, the game is a **draw**.
